// Marking a department's work on an SO (or one EC of it) finished.
//
// The derived statuses elsewhere — the Departments popup, the order-list filter
// — infer progress from whatever the department happened to fill in. That
// answers "has anything been recorded?", not "are you done?". A department
// signing off explicitly is what closes the loop, and it is what makes the time
// taken measurable: completion date minus the target date the department was
// originally given.
//
// Plain module (no server imports) so the checkbox and the SQL behind it agree.
