// How to read one pipeline row from a department's point of view: the status
// it is in, whether that counts as finished, whether the department is
// involved at all, and the date it is working to.
//
// Every dashboard reads these rather than restating them — the central
// pipeline, the department dashboards, and anything counting "how many are
// pending" — so a rule changes in one place.
//
// Plain module (no server imports): the dashboards are client components.
